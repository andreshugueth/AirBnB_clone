## :bookmark\_tabs: Description
Command interpreter to manage your AirBnB objects.
This is the first step towards building your first full web application: the AirBnB clone. This first step is very important because you will use what you build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integrationâ€¦

## :straight\_ruler: Requirements

### Python Scripts

* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
* The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
* Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7 or more)
* All your files must be executable

### Python Unit Tests

* All your test files should be inside a folder tests
* All your test files and folders should start by test_
* Your file organization in the tests folder should be the same as your project
* e.g., For models/base_model.py, unit tests must be in: tests/test\_models/test\_base\_model.py
* e.g., For models/user.py, unit tests must be in: tests/test\_models/test\_user.py
* All your tests should be executed by using this command: python3 -m unittest discover tests
* You can also test file by file by using this command: python3 -m unittest tests/test\_models/test\_base\_model.py
